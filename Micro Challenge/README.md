# NKHook5-Scripts/Micro Challenge

You can read the description here and in the console of NKHook5. All of the 
description is just copy and pasted from what I put as the description in the console.

Description:

How to play:
You play by starting any game. The way on how this challenge is you start with 550 cash
you can get cash but every second your cash resets back to 550. The reason why its
called the micro challenge is because you are supposed to buy towers sell those towers
so you have alot of money then with in 1 second to buy better towers.
Thank you Danny Parker because a lot of the code is based off of what he put in #general
Micro Challenge is somewhat made by me, EpicGamer. Discord: EpicGamer#3273
