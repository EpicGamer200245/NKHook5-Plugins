# NKHook5-Plugins/Impossible

You can read the description here and in the console of NKHook5. All of the 
description is just copy and pasted from what I put as the description in the console.

Description:

What this script is make the game pretty much
impossible. This is what it does:
When a bloon leaks it takes 3 times the amount of damage.
When a bloon leaks it takes 25 money.
When you upgrade a tower it takes 500 dollars along
with the cost of that upgrade.
